[Advice Auctions](http://nikete.com/advice_auctions.pdf) may be the mechanism that enables market driven decision making. It is based on an old and simple idea, giving your advisors a share of the reward, with an algorithmic twist of facilitating the advisors themselves seeking advice in the same way recursively.  The space these markets work over is explcitly not expectations over actions but instead the selection of a good policy for making them. This makes auditing the advice posible, as well as evaluating it's counter-factual performance. 

Recently [Osterheld and Conitzer](https://users.cs.duke.edu/~conitzer/decisionWINE20.pdf) show a fundamental limit to elicitation for decision making, only the best action and itâ€™s expected reward are elicitable. Advice auctions match this precisely, further they are able to deal with complementary information distributed between different experts, something that betting mechanisms used prediction markets fail at.

In the spirit of [Constructive Economics](https://web.archive.org/web/20161229154937/http://aiecon.tumblr.com/post/489827144/what-is-constructive-economics) the focus is on making it real. Smart contracts running on proof-of-stake blockchains provide a playground for experimenting with novel economic structures. A self-referential experiment in computational social science: a DAO run by, and dedicated to the development of, practical designs for incentivizing advice that leads to better choices. The DAO itself making decisions using the proposed mechanisms. 

The goal is to experiment with what applications are well suited to these mechanisms, how the mechanisms need to be refined, and what is needed to make this happen.  Potential applications:

* choosing if a seed stage fundaraising team/project should be funded
* choosing profit maximizing bid-ask spreads for automated market makers, more broadly choosing parameters of control systems in governance minimized systems.
* choosing suppliers when quality is hard to observe ex-ante but affects an ex-post observable reward
* choosing what to learn to maximize market income in some future period

After some conversations about advice auctions and related work on decision elicitation, at the [DIMACS Workshop on Forecasting: From Forecasts to Decisions](http://dimacs.rutgers.edu/events/details?eID=1873) and conversations witht he open research collectives aroun the Ethereum ecosystem, there seems to be enough  momentum to have a open research collective for research and design on advice and policy elicitation.
